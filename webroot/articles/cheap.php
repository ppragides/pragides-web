			<h2>Play Cheap Golf?</h2>
			
			<p>Make no mistake about it; golf is an expensive sport to play.  We have all thought of the cheapest ways to play golf, but how exactly
			do you get the best deals on green fees?</p>
			
			<h3>Set a per-round budget</h3>
			<p>The first thing that you need to do would be to set a personal maximum price that you would be willing to pay for a round of golf.
			Once you have set this limit, try and stay within it for every round that you play. My personal limit is at $50 per round.</p>
			
			<p>Remember that there will be other additional costs that you may want to consider prior to teeing off:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Range balls</li>
				<li>Power/pull cart</li>
				<li>Beverages/snacks</li>
				<li>Tees</li>
				<li>Balls</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Be as prepared as you can be prior to arriving at the clubhouse.  If the course you frequent is walkable, consider investing in a pull
			cart; it will pay for itself after a few rounds. Bring a bottle (or two) of water and a light snack.  Do you have enough balls to last 
			your entire round? Did you bring enough tees?</p>
			
			<p>Depending on the golf course, some give you complimentary tees, a warm-up bucket of balls, ball markers and bottles of water.</p>
			
			<h3>Sign up for email alerts</h3>
			
			<p>This is by far the most reliable and consistent option that we've found that would give you access to deals that golf courses offer,
			especially during non-peak times.  Keep an eye out on your mailbox and you might be surprised at the rates that golf courses offer.</p>
			
			<h3>Groupon</h3>
			
			<p>Watch out for local Groupon deals.  Most golf courses would have occassional deals that they post up on Groupon that will be
			a great value.  The most common deals that we've found are 2-for-1 green fees which includes a power cart.</p>
			
			<h3>Call your local golf course</h3>
			
			<p>Have you tried phoning your local golf course to see if they'd give you a better rate than what they have posted on their website
			or online booking system?  Give it a try - you might be surprised.  A lot of golf courses ar every flexible on their rates, especially
			on days with inclement weather.  Remember, a golfer paying to play at 50% of their posted rate is better than a vacant tee time.</p>
